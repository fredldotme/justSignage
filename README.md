# Welcome to freeSignage

### Project scope
* Provide base technologies for digital signage purposes
* Write once, run on every hardware
* Easy to integrate into existing solutions
* Easy to set up and get going

### Basics
* Your experience is an app, or a set of apps
* Your experience is interactive
* Your experience moves rather than staying static
* This means animations in and between your content
* Your experience can require multiple devices

### Specifics

* Networks can have multiple communities
* Communities are devices and apps interacting amongst themselves
* Automatic sharing of new content within the community
* Dynamic switching between content rather than static playlists

### Technologies
